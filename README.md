# Farrel Mahardhika Fajar - Data Analyst Portofolio
## About
Greetings! You can call me Farrel! 
I am an electrical engineering graduate with biomedical engineering master's degree. 
I am interested in churning through data to uncover possible insights, hence why I'm aspiring myself to become a data analyst.

With my three-year experience as a Technical Design management staff at a High Speed Railway company in an Indonesia-China collaboration National Strategic Project, I have trained myself to become familiar with all sorts of data manipulation, be it via Excel, Power BI, and SQL. I believe those skills will be a valuable assets in my future role involving data.

I spend my time looking at publicly-released data and thinking what can I do with it, from cleaning, exploring, to visualizing. I am driven by the thrill of discovering possible new insights and share them to my colleagues and people online.
